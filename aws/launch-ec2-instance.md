# Launch EC2 Instance

## Task

> The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.
>
> For this task, create an EC2 instance with following requirements:
> 1. The name of the instance must be `nautilus-ec2`.
> 2. You can use the `Amazon Linux` AMI to launch this instance.
> 3. The Instance type must be `t2.micro`.
> 4. Create a new RSA key pair named `nautilus-kp`.
> 5. Attach the default (available by default) security group.

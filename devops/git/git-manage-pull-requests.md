# Git Manage Pull Requests

## Task

> Max want to push some new changes to one of the repositories but we don't want people to push directly to `master` branch, since that would be the final version of the code. It should always only have content that has been reviewed and approved. We cannot just allow everyone to directly push to the `master` branch. So, let's do it the right way as discussed below:
>
> * SSH into storage server using user `max`, password `Max_pass123`. There you can find an already cloned repo under Max user's home.
> * Max has written his story about The ü¶ä Fox and Grapes üçá
> * Max has already pushed his story to remote git repository hosted on Gitea branch `story/fox-and-grapes`
> * Check the contents of the cloned repository. Confirm that you can see Sarah's story and history of commits by running `git log` and validate author info, commit message etc.
> * Max has pushed his story, but his story is still not in the `master` branch. Let's create a Pull Request(PR) to merge Max's `story/fox-and-grapes` branch into the master branch
> * Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea page.
>   * Username: `max`
>   * Password: `Max_pass123`
>   * PR title : `Added fox-and-grapes story`
>   * PR pull from branch: `story/fox-and-grapes` (source)
>   * PR merge into branch: `master` (destination)
> * Before we can add our story to the `master` branch, it has to be reviewed. So, let's ask `tom` to review our PR by assigning him as a reviewer. Add tom as reviewer through the Git Portal UI
>   * Go to the newly created PR
>   * Click on Reviewers on the right
>   * Add `tom` as a reviewer to the PR
> * Now let's review and approve the PR as user Tom. Login to the portal with the user tom
>   * Username: `tom`
>   * Password: `Tom_pass123`
>   * PR title : `Added fox-and-grapes story`
>   * Review and merge it.
>
> Great stuff!! The story has been merged! üëè

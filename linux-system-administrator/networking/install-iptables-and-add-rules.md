# Iptables Httpd & httpd

## Task

> We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e `5004` is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:
> * Install `iptables` and all its dependencies on each app host.
> * Block incoming port `5004` on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
> * Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

## Preliminary Steps

1. Check the architecture map at https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/58e22de2-c446-4b49-ae0f-db79a3318e97/0_0
2. Check server details at https://kodekloudhub.github.io/kodekloud-engineer/docs/projects/nautilus

## Research

* `iptables` overview.
  * https://www.howtogeek.com/177621/the-beginners-guide-to-iptables-the-linux-firewall/
  * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-the-iptables-firewall-works
* Check the default policy chain behaviour, standard is to ACCEPT
  * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-list-and-delete-iptables-firewall-rules
* Insert at postion 1 means the first rule AFTER the policy rules.

## Steps

Follow [Passwordless ssh setup](networking/passwordless-ssh-access.md) for every user.

```bash
# Check thor /etc/hosts for LBR server
grep -i stlb01 /etc/hosts
```

```
172.16.238.14   stlb01
```

The IP address matches https://kodekloudhub.github.io/kodekloud-engineer/docs/projects/nautilus#infrastructure-details

```bash
ssh tony@stapp01

# Get root
sudo -i

# Check current Linux version, it was CentOS Stream 8.
cat /etc/*rel*

# Check if firewalld is running, and it wasn't.
systemctl status firewalld

# Check if iptables is running, it wasn't installed.
systemctl status iptables

# Install iptables and iproute for networking commands like `ss`.
dnf install -y iptables-services iproute

# Automatically start iptables at boot time and start it right now
systemctl enable --now iptables

# Check what is listening, httpd was on 5004
ss -lntp
```

```bash

# Insert at postion 1 means the first rule AFTER the policy rules.
iptables --insert INPUT 1 --protocol tcp --source 172.16.238.14 --dport 5004 --jump ACCEPT


# Reject incoming TCP connections from 0.0.0.0:5004 (everywhere else)
# DROP does it silently, REJECT lets them know the connection was refused.
iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 5004 -j REJECT

# Check our new rules
iptables -L -n
```

```

We can see our accept rule at the top and our deny rule below them.

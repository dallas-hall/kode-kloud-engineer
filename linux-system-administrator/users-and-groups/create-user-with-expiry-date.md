# Create A User With Expiry Date

## Task

> A developer ammar has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for ammar. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.<br><br>Therefore, create a user named `ammar` on the App Server 3. Set expiry date to 2021-04-15 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

## Preliminary Steps

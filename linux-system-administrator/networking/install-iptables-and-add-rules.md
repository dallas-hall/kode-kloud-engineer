# Iptables Httpd & Nginx

## Task

> We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e `5001` is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:<br><br>Install `iptables` and all its dependencies on each app host.<br>Block incoming port `3001` on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.<br>Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

## Preliminary Steps

1. Check the architecture map at https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/58e22de2-c446-4b49-ae0f-db79a3318e97/0_0
2. Check server details at https://kodekloudhub.github.io/kodekloud-engineer/docs/projects/nautilus

## Research

* `iptables` overview https://www.howtogeek.com/177621/the-beginners-guide-to-iptables-the-linux-firewall/ & https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-the-iptables-firewall-works
* Check the default policy chain behaviour, standard is to ACCEPT  - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-list-and-delete-iptables-firewall-rules
* Insert at postion 1 means the first rule AFTER the policy rules - https://serverfault.com/questions/163111/allow-traffic-to-from-specific-ip-with-iptables
* Saving `iptables` rules https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands

## Steps

Follow [Passwordless ssh setup](networking/passwordless-ssh-access.md) for every user.

```bash
# Get root on thor
sudo -i

# Check O/S, it was CentOS 7
cat /etc/*release*

# Install bind-utils for resolution like nslookup, host.
yum install -y bind-utils
```

```
...
Installed:
  bind-utils.x86_64 32:9.11.4-26.P2.el7_9.10
...
```

```bash
# Find the IP address of the LBR server
host stlb01
```

```
stlb01 has address 172.17.0.8
```

```bash
# Check thor /etc/hosts for LBR server
grep -i stlb01 /etc/hosts
```

```
172.16.238.14   stlb01
```

The IP addresses are different to lets take a closer look.

```bash
# Connect to stlb01
ssh loki@loki@stlb01

# Check the IP addresses, there were 3 interfaces
ip -c -h a
```

```
...

```

There are 3 IP addresses:
1. 172.16.238.14/24 from `/etc/hosts` on thor
2. 172.16.239.5/24 we haven't seen.
3. 172.17.0.8/16 from `host` output on thor.

We can see our accept rules at the top and our deny rule below them.
